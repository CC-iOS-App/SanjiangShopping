# SanjiangShopping
My First iOS Application.  
We are not open API and other logic, Just open UI Source code for learning.  
SanjiangShopping is an Shopping interface, not supported by backend.  

Maybe it is not the best demo, but it is a detailed demo.  

## Requirements
Xcode 7, iOS 8 or later.

## How To Get Started

- git clone git@github.com:XueSeason/SanjiangShopping.git
